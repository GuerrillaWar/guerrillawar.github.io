Guerrilla War is a major conversion mod for XCOM 2, that aims to overhaul both strategic and tactical layers to model a worldwide insurgency/counterinsurgency effort. Playing as XCOM, build up the Resistance to win over popular support and take back your world while avoiding destruction at the hands of ADVENT’s superior military.
