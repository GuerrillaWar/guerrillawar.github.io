# Strategy

The Avenger is the fighting vanguard of the Resistance. Able to relocate quickly across the world, their presence and actions inspire pockets of resistance to set up camps out of ADVENT’s reach. Build up material capability by raiding guard posts, and ambushing convoys, before infiltrating the cities to indoctrinate, recruit, steal and sabotage in the cover of the crowd.

Collect intel on major ADVENT supply lines and installations and wear down their ability to fight whilst winning over popular support. Beware of discovery, the guerrilla only survives if they can’t be found, and your actions won’t go unnoticed, with patrols roaming the country side to locate your pockets of resistance, and crackdowns on safe houses within the cities.

Build the Resistance into a true force capable of opposing the ADVENT coalition, but beware, becoming a conventional army means becoming a very visible target. The price of liberation is escalation, and the Resistance will need your help to prevent ADVENT from destroying and retaking your freed regions.

# Intersection

Every soldier you kill is one less ADVENT in the world. Units are counted down to the last, squads on site according to strategy, will be waiting for you in the garrison if you attack. Reinforcements are projected from Transport bases in the area, and how far they are away from the AO corresponds to how long you can expect to wait before the hammer drops and you need to leave.

Convoys and soldiers carry real equipment that you will need for the ongoing fight, spending precious turns stealing crates or looting downed ADVENT for their weapons and ammunition. Soldiers left behind in combat will become prisoners of war, to be interrogated for crucial information that could compromise the Resistance in the zone. You can immediately return for a rescue, or attempt to ambush their transfer convoy, the choice is yours.

The objectives are what you decide they are. If you think it's best - or easier - to destroy a convoy rather than loot it, you may. When Advent cracks down on safe houses, you can merely buy time for the informants to escape, or use it as an opportunity to show the people Advent aren't invincible. If you arrive at a site with prisoners of war, you can stage a breakout, or go one further and destroy it. What occurs in tactical has direct intersection with your strategic goals in the region.

# Tactics

A guerrilla war is a mobile war, and its tactics will reflect that. Arrive on the battlefield in concealment by land, or go loud and rope in with the Skyranger. Night and day become real strategic choices with longer visibility during the day, and more conspicuous gunfire during the night. Scout the battlefield with new tools and make your plan of attack based on relatively complete information like a proper guerrilla band should.

ADVENT won’t take an ambush lying down though. With the psionic network connecting captains with their subordinates, expect a coordinated response from the remainder of the map. If they think they have the advantage, expect them to actively repel your attack. If they feel they don’t have the numbers, they’ll attempt to hold ground and call in reinforcements. ADVENT will also field more combined arms, so sitting back trading shots won’t be an option, suppression and flanking are critical tools to your success.

Fight like a real infantry, with fire and movement being core tenets to survival. With more fire options and missed shots contributing to aim penalising suppression, moving for flanks is safer and encouraged. Area effects are strengthened, yet made more situational with grenades either exploding next turn, or needing to be primed to get contact explosions. Guerrilla War tactics is less about damage jenga, and more about finding the enemy, fixing them within a dilemma, and then manoeuvring for a killing flank.
